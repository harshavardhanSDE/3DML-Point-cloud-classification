A Neural network trained to classify parts of CAD model.

## Point cloud data

A [point cloud](https://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.html "Point cloud ") is a collection of data points defined in a given coordinate system, where these points represents the external surface of an object or space, typically generated by 3D scanners, LIDAR, or Photogrammetry. Each point in the cloud has XYZ coordinate, and often additional attributes such as color, intensity and timestamp.

## Vector Database.

A vector database stores high-dimensional vector data efficiently and supports operations like similarity search. They are particularly suitable for applications involving machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing.

Vector databases are optimized for managing and querying high-dimensional data vectors, which are commong in machine learning and AI application.

They support fast similarity search operations such as nears neighbour search, which are crucial for tasks like image retrieval, document similarity.

Many vector databases are designed to integrate seamlessly with machine learning workflows and data pipelines.

### Why vector databases for Point cloud.

Point clouds consists of a large number of points in a high-dimensional space. Vector databases can efficiently store these high-dimensional vectors.

When working with point clouds, it's often necessary to retrieve points that are spatially close to a given point.
